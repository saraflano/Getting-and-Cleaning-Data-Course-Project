# Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## The "run_analysis" code modifies the original dataset by merging the data into one data file, adds labels to variables, extracts the mean and standard deviation data for each variable, adds/modifies descriptive labels to data columns and activities, and creates a new dataset of the average of each variable for each activity and subject called "tidydata.txt".
